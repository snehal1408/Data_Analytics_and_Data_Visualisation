This virus is spreading around the world very rapidly, and it has already affected thousands of people. As of 17th October 2020, a total of 39.1 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 1.1 million deaths were reported worldwide.\n",

        "A vaccine is a substance that helps protect against certain diseases like COVID-19. Vaccines teach our immune system about creating antibodies that protects you from the disease. This sort of immunity can stay in our body for years, and our immune system remembers how to fight that same infection. If enough people are vaccinated, it is harder for the disease to spread to those people who are not vaccinated, and that concept is called 'herd immunity'.\n",

The data was collected from the participants across different demographics and categories such as age range, occupation, level of education, gender, income level, marital status, accommodation status, employment status, location, location type, no of adults in the house, no of children in the house, employment industry and employment occupation etc. The data represented different views and concerns about the participants understanding of flu and COVID-19 vaccines and are they taking all the precautions such as wearing a face mask, washing hands frequently, avoid gathering, avoid travelling etc.\n",

So we can also say that  people are more worried about getting sick with covid vaccine as compare to seasonal flu vaccine. Here, if we do addition of participants i.e., (around 1500 + around 750) or (around 1750 + aroud 500) than we will get total number of participant i.e., around 2300."
